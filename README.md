### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I'm Sonny

I'm currently a lead ux engineer [@Grab](https://grab.com) working to make designers work easier and to experiment what's possible with design and code.

In my spare time, I created tools to make design easy in figma. You can go to [figma.com/@sonny](https://figma.com/@sonny) to check my figma plugins.

I also open sourced some side projects on @github. Check out some projects below ðŸ‘‡
